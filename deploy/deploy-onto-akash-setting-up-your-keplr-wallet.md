## Setting up a Wallet

### Chrome
> [Video Guide](https://youtu.be/m3uhEHjzqfA)

Instructions:
 - Open [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap/related?hl=en) link and press 'Add to Chrome'. Confirm the addition of the extension.
 - If it's not visible in the top-right hierarchy with extension icons, press the puzzle logo, find Keplr, and pin it. 
 - Press it to open the wallet.
 - Now, there are multiple choices, and you can do whichever one you like:
   - To 'Sign in with Google', choose a username/password for your wallet before authorizing it with your Google account.
   - To 'Create new account' you will get prompted by a 12-24 word seed phrase which you should write down. After that, choose a username/password for your wallet. Press 'Next'. Then, confirm your seed phrase and press 'Register'.
   - You can also import an existing account or import your ledger :)
 - You should now be able to find your Akash address by pressing the 'Cosmos' dropdown in the top and pressing 'Akash'.
 - These addresses start with 'akash' in lowercase.

## Funding your Wallet

### Centralized Exchanges
> Buying AKT from centralized exchanges is probably the easiest way unless they enforce KYC. 
> It will cost some, but is generally a good option aslong as the exchanges exist, because of the fact that centralized exchanges usually have cheaper prices than their decentralized counterparts.

A list of centralized exchanges can be found near the bottom of [this](https://akash.network/token) page. Generally, you'll see a workflow similar to this:

- Deposit any supported crypto. Sometimes they allow bank deposits.
- See which trading pairs they have with AKT. Generally you'll need USDt, BTC, or ETH.
- If you don't already have USDt, BTC, ETH, or whatever the supported pairs are, make a trade for either of those with your deposit.
- Trade this newly acquired currency to AKT.
- Withdraw your AKT to your Keplr Wallet.

### Decentralized Exchanges
> Decentralized Exchanges are great if you want to acquire AKT in a trustless fashion. It requires some prerequisites, though.

If you want to use the Osmosis decentralized exchange, you'll need some prerequisites such as a wallet and ATOM. Take a look [here](https://akash.network/blog/how-to-access-and-provide-akt-token-liquidity-on-osmosis) if you're interested in more information.

### Apply for Funding
> Akash recently introduced Developer Grants, which is a funding system where you first get $100 after proposing your project.
> After that, you may apply for additional grants of $1,000, $10,000, and $100,000 worth of AKT.

If you want to apply for funding, you can do so by following these steps: <sub>[which are also listed here](https://forum.akash.network/t/how-to-apply-for-developer-grants/685)</sub>
 - Navigate to the [Akash Forum](https://forum.akash.network/) and click 'Register'.
 - Join the [Akash Discord Server](https://discord.gg/uJ7NWdF4hn).
 - Navigate [here](https://forum.akash.network/my/preferences/profile) and enter your akash address from Keplr in the 'Akash Account Address' field.
 - Click the ['Account Tab'](https://forum.akash.network/my/preferences/account) and publish a matching profile picture to your Discord account.
 - Go to the [Grants tab](https://forum.akash.network/c/grants/new/), press '+ New Topic' and write out the answers to the on-screen questions.
 - Now you should receive $100 worth of AKT within a day or two!

If you want to take it even further from there, check out the [Grants Applications](https://forum.akash.network/c/grants/apply/) and answer the questions there. This will lead to the bigger grants at $1,000, $10,000, and $100,000.

## Continuing/what now?

Now after you have your wallet, you might want to check out the [deployment guide](https://docs.akash.network/guides/deployment) to learn how to deploy. If you're on Windows, you might want to check out [this](https://www.akashlytics.com/deploy) deploy tool.

If you need to learn how to use Docker and dockerizing your applications, do that first. There are many free tutorials that are perfect for most use-cases on YouTube, and you can always ask for help.

If you want inspiration, want to see previously built applications, or just host other applications, check out the [Awesome Akash repo](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash).
